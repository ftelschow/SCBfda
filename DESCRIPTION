Title: Simultaneous Confidence Bands for Functional Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Fabian J.E. Telschow
Maintainer: Fabian J.E. Telschow <ftelschow@ucsd.edu>
Description: This package computes simultaneous confidence bands for the
    population mean or the population signal to noise ratio of a sample
    of functional data on a rectangular domain in 1D or 2D.
    It has the option to estimate the quantile with a non-parametric bootstrap
    or a multiplier bootstrap. The main novelty is that it also includes
    estimation of the quantile using the Gaussian Kinematic formula. Please
    consult the description of a function to choose the apropriate method for
    your application.
    The default and recommanded quantile estimation is the Gaussian Kineamtic
    formula for t-processes.
